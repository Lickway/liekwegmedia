## Jordan Liekweg

I am a driven full stack web developer passionate about people and productivity. Creating solutions to better myself and my team are always on my mind. With my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, and more, I am confident in my ability to be a successful teammate and peer. Letâ€™s cultivate an environment filled with critical thinking, together, so that we can continue to learn. 


## [Memory Game](http://elastic-volhard-069df6.bitballoon.com/)
My first shot at jQuery JavaScript DOM manipulation. In a 4 day sprint, I was able to utilize freshly learned skills in DOM manipulation without using any outside packages. From this project, I learned the importance of pseudocode, adding notes within my code, and creating reusable functions.

## [Ewokagram](https://ewokagram.herokuapp.com/)
In this 4 day sprint, I spent two weeks learning brand new material such as PostgreSQL, Node, Express, and how to handle promises. From these I was able to build a web-based photo app inspired by Instagram. To handle photo storage, I used Amazon S3.

## [Ewokese Messaging App](https://github.com/Lickway/Ewokese)
Another 4 day sprint project built with a group of 3. Through this project, we utilized git branching, group communication and assignment after two weeks of learning React, user authentication, user stories, and more. 

## [WatchList](https://github.com/Lickway/WatchList)
A React Native mobile application built in a 7 day sprint. With no prior experience working with mobile applications, I was able to build an app that allows the user to search for a movie and find an online location to stream it. This app uses Firebase, Axios, and the API Utelly.
